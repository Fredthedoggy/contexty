## What is Contexty?
Contexty is a single-purpose [Discord](https://discord.com/) Bot created to solve the issue of linked messages being incredibly clunky, and causing you to lose your place in a conversation.

## How can I use it?
A Public instance of Contexty is available on [Top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/954551864656007198) ([Direct Invite](https://top.gg/bot/954551864656007198/invite))

To set it up using the public instance
1. Open the [Direct Invite](https://top.gg/bot/954551864656007198/invite)
2. Select your server under "**ADD TO SERVER**", and click "**Continue**"
3. Navigate to your Server
4. Run `/config view`, and modify settings as you see fit
5. Modify your server's channel permissions to allow Contexty to read messages, send messages, and embed links in the channels you want it to work in
6. Click **`‚ãØ`** when highlighting a message, and select `Copy Message Link üîó`
7. Paste the link into the channel, send your message, and voil√†!
